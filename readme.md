# filemk

A simple tool for creating files from the command line.

Github: https://github.com/iammadab/filemk

Npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/filemk

## Inspiration
I was inspired to create this tool, becuase I couldn't find a good way to create files from the windows terminal. Although this is a cross platform tool and can work on any os, it was built with the windows user in mind.

## Install

```javascript
    npm install -g filemk
```

## Usage

You can create any number of files by seperating the filenames with spaces

You create files using the "mk" or "filemk" command


```javascript
    mk app.js // Creates the app.js in the current director

    mk testFile.txt hello.css index.html // Creates the three files in the current directory

```
